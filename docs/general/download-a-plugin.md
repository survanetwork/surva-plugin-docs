# Downloading a plugin

## Official download

You can download the latest version of our plugins from our **[offical plugins portal](https://dev.surva.net/plugins/)**.

There is a "Direct download" button for every plugin. Click on it to download the latest stable version.

## Download from Poggit

Alternatively, you can download the packed plugin file (PHAR file) from Poggit.

A version which is not always up to date but approved by the Poggit team is available [here](https://poggit.pmmp.io/plugins/by/survanetwork). Download it by selecting the plugin and then clicking on the black "Direct Download" button.

Now you should have a file with the file extension ".phar" in your Downloads folder.
