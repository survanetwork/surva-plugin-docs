# Install a plugin on the server

To install the plugin, you can just put the PHAR-file you downloaded in the step before into the `plugins` folder in your PocketMine-folder. You need to start the server once so the config files needed for the next step are created. Config files are stored in the `plugin_data` folder of your server.
