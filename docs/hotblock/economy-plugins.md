# Adding an economy plugin

**Supported economy plugins:** [EconomyAPI](https://poggit.pmmp.io/p/EconomyAPI), [Capital](https://poggit.pmmp.io/p/Capital) and [BedrockEconomy](https://poggit.pmmp.io/p/BedrockEconomy).

Just add one of these economy plugins to your server's plugin folder. It will be automatically detected and used by HotBlock. It's also possible to use no economy plugin, there will be no money reward to players, but the game will still work.
