# Gameplay

The goal for the players is to stand as long as possible on the 'Hot Block' in the middle of the arena in order to earn money (using supported economy providers). Because every player wants to get there, there is an exiting PvP-match. The dangerous poisoned blocks are making the game even more exiting.

The HotBlock game doesn't have a beginning or ending, it's an open game which is always running when players are in the world.
