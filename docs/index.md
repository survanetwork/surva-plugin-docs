# Welcome

On our open source plugin docs page, you can find the official documentation and tutorials for our plugins, including Worlds, AllSigns, HotBlock and BadWordBlocker. The documentation usually contains instructions on how to setup the plugin and edit the config, which commands can be used with the plugin and how the plugin is designed to work in general.

Our documentation itself is also open source and you can contribute to it on its [repository](https://github.com/survanetwork/surva-plugin-docs).
